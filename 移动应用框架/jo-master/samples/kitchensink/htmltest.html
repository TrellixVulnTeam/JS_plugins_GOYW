<h1>Embedded HTML</h1>

<p>This HTML fragment was loaded dynamically. The joHTML control
also intercepts <a href="htmltestlink.html">links</a> so you
can keep them on the page. This is useful for pure content cases
such as disclaimers, app info, and help.</p>

<p><em>Note that since Jo uses custom tag names for its controls,
you should have little if any CSS overlap with your App UI.</em></p>
